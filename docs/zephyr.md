## Zephyr Setup
Zephyr is an open-source, real-time operating system (RTOS) for resource-constrained and embedded devices.
It works on multiple archtictures, and has support for [many different devices](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/#).
Using Zephyr provides an extensive ecosystem including a kernel, libraries, device drivers, and file systems that simplify developing applications for embedded systems.

### Zephyr Installation
Follow Zephyr's official [getting started guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html).
This will give you a complete guide to setting up a Zephyr installation on your system, which is needed to compile and debug the sample projects.
